3 Observable Trends from part 1:
1.) When plotting Temperature vs. Latitude an upside down "U"-shaped curve is distiguishable with the center being focussed around the equator (0 degrees). This suggests that the farther north or south you move from the equator the colder it becomes. 
2.) Similarly as above for Wind Speed vs Latitude a rightside up "U" shape is shown by the data cetered around the equator again, suggesting that the further north and south from the equator you go the windier it becomes in general.  
3.) There seems to be a weak or nigh discernable correlation ((based on the  R-Squared (Correlation Coefficients))between both Cloudiness and Humidity when compared to Latitude. This holds true when you split either into Northern or Southern Hemispheres.
